# Risk

## Description
This project is a digital implementation of the classic strategy board game Risk. In this game, players aim to conquer territories and eliminate their opponents through strategic planning and tactical maneuvers.
You can try the game yourself at https://riskgame.azurewebsites.net/. Please note that the game may run a bit slowly as it is hosted for free. You can play with friends or against the computer.

## How to Play
The goal of the game is to take over the world with your soldiers. By conquering an entire continent, you gain more soldiers faster. The game consists of three phases adding soldiers, attacking and moving soldiers.

### Adding Soldiers
To add soldiers, click on a country you own and choose how many soldiers you want to add to that country. 
You can see the number of soldiers available to add at the top of the page, slightly to the right. Once you have added all the soldiers, you will automatically proceed to the attacking phase.

### Attacking
To attack an opponent, first click on one of your countries and then click on the opponent's country you want to attack. The country you want to attack needs to be within range of the first country you clicked on. 
The computer will determine the outcome of the battle, and you can see the results in the chat on the right.
You can attack as many times as you want, but the attacking country needs to have more soldiers than the defending country.

### Moving Soldiers
To move soldiers, click on the country you want to move soldiers from and then click on the second country that will receive the soldiers. Choose how many soldiers you want to move. 
You need to own both countries, and there must be a pathway of countries you own connecting them.
All countries must have at least one soldier in them, so you cannot move all soldiers out of a country.
